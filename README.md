# Custom Smart Deadbolt 

Brainstormed, designed, built, and programmed a smart deadbolt from scratch

<br>

## Summary
- Attaches to my backdoorâ€™s built-in deadbolt and turns the deadbolt lever to lock and unlock door
- Seamlessly integrates with my custom smart home ecosystem, allowing for easily monitoring and control from phones and PCs
- Leverages radio modules for communication with smart home controller 
- Powered by an Arduino Pro Mini 5v that drives a high torque TT motor 
- The enclosure and all internal parts were designed from scratch in Autodesk Inventor and 3D printed by yours truly
- Limit switch senses when door is closed
- Custom modular design allows for rapid prototyping and iterative design
