# Custom Smart Deadbolt 

Brainstormed, designed, built, and programmed a smart deadbolt from scratch

<br>

## Summary
- Attaches to my backdoorâ€™s OEM deadbolt and turns the deadbolt lever to lock and unlock door
  - Mounts to the door and deadbolt without any adhesive or mounting hardware that could potentially damage the door
- Leverages radio modules for communication with smart home controller 
- Powered by an Arduino Pro Mini 5v that drives a high torque TT motor 
- Comprised of 13 different 3D-printed parts
  - Designed from scratch in Autodesk Inventor and 3D printed by yours truly
  - Custom modular design allows for rapid prototyping and iterative design 
- The deadbolt lever has a 3D-printed adapter that snaps around it (no adhesive necesssary) to convert it into one big gear 
  - This gear is then turned by the TT motor through a smaller gear with half the teeth which  
- Limit switch senses when door is closed or open - useful for functionality such as preventing deadbolt from being extended when trying to shut door
- Potentiometer sitting opposite the motor shaft provides two-fold functionality: 
  - Acts as an axle of sorts for the gear driven by the TT motor
  - Is a highly precise, non-volatile, axle "encoder" that allows for knowing the position of the deadbolt gear, and can thus infer when the deadbolt is turned into the unlocked or locked position
- Seamlessly integrates with my custom smart home ecosystem
- Functionality provided by Smart Home:
  - Automatically locks deadbolt after a minute if it is left unlocked
  - Remote monitoring of whether door is ajar/open
  - Remote monitoring and control of the deadbolt from anywhere, enabling the ability to let guests into home remotely
  - Function that prevents deadbolt from locking for any reason - useful for when you want to step outside quickly without needing your keys or a smarthpone 
- Currently on its **4th** major version (V4)
  - V1 was the proof of concept
  - V2 was a more complete prototype, with only small improvements over V2, mostly just improved modularity 
  - V3 saw the complete overhaul of the design into a proper enclosure with better modularity and better complexity
  - V4 took V3's complete design and cleaned up the aesthetics considerably, while adding fully realized modularity allowing for the addition of more attachments and sensors
