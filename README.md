# Smart IoT Deadbolt Controller

Smart deadbolt controller leveraging MySensors for connectivity running on an Arduino pro micro which manipulates a TT motor to turn a standard deadbolt.

<br>

## Summary
 - Fully custom enclosure and mounting bracket designed by yours truly in Autodesk Inventer and 3D printed in-house
 - Tooless, modular design allowed for rapid prototyping and iterative design
 - Custom designed 3D printed components: Enclosure, door mounting system, motor mount, gear adapter for deadbolt thumb latch, and gear driven by motor with hole for potentiometer
 - Specially designed to not require any modification to existing deadbolt or door
